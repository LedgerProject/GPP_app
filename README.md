## Global Passport Project

Global Passport Project is a breakthrough initiative that leverages on decentralized technology to support mixed migrants along their journey, protect their privacy while reporting human rights violations, and engage them as citizens integrating in their new communities. GPP will also enormously improve the capacity of NGOs and social enterprises to reach out to migrants and design their actions, thus streamlining their resources and improving their performance and records when applying for funds and calls.

GPP is a blockchain-based platform with a website and mobile App through which mixed migrants can safely store important documents, access info on the countries crossed and the solidarity network in the area they are in, as well as report on abuses they might face along the journey. All data is personal and inviolable, and it will be kept on Blockchain with a double-level encryption component.

* GPPâ€™s key tool is the first ever DocWallet, a unique and innovative "safe space" where migrants can scan and upload their ID, educational or medical records that might get lost during their journey or might not be convenient to keep them physically with them. The lack of documentation is often a key issue in the migratory process.

* GPP App will provide the user with a detailed and comprehensive mapping of solidarity structures in transit/destination countries: upon voluntary geolocalization, an interactive map will provide information on the structures (i.e. associations, collectives, unions, NGOs, lawyers, humanitarian protection) and also up-to-date information on the legislation in force in every country and territory crossed.

* GPP is also a multimedia tool for mixed migrant to report and document abuses faced along the journey after being provided with a brief tutorial on citizen journalism.

The platform is designed WITH migrants rather than FOR migrants: they are the main and ultimate beneficiaries of this project, whose aim is to enable them to embark in safer journeys and experience an easier settling, but also to engage them as active subjects of participatory democracy practices and a narrative process that will start from their first hand experiences as narrating subjects rather than narrated ones.

It is meant to serve as an innovative tool also for the third sector (NGOs, aid agencies) to access information and first-hand data that go beyond government control and a useful tool to improve and strengthen their interventions. GPP may also contribute to an in-depth reconsideration of the operational modalities which are very often blamed for adopting a top-down approach. The possibility to receive detailed information and to be able to directly get in contact with their targets and potential beneficiaries will allow to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their actions, and ensure a streamlined use of the resources.

## Starting a development environment

### Prerequisites

* npm and node.js: first of all install npm and node.js (https://nodejs.org/it/download/)

* React Native Community CLI: install the React Native Community CLI (https://github.com/react-native-community/cli)

```sh
npm install -g @react-native-community/cli
```

* GPP_backend: configure the GPP_backend environment, available at: (https://github.com/LedgerProject/GPP_backend)

### Configure the environment

Open a terminal and make a clone of this repository on your machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/LedgerProject/GPP_app
```

Install the npm packages. Go to the project directory and run:

```sh
npm install
```

After the modules installation, configure the environment. Make a copy of the /src/services/app-env-example.ts named /src/services/app-env.ts and edit the new file:

```sh
<backend url> change with the backend URL (please configure the GPP_backend environment, available at: (https://github.com/LedgerProject/GPP_backend)
<google maps api key> change with your Google Maps API key (remember Maps SDK for Android and Maps SDK for iOS)
```

### Available scripts
